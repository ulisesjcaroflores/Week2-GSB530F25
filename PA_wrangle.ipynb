        "#### Check results often\n",
        "\n",
        "If a chunk of code runs smoothly without giving you any error or warnings this does not necessarily mean it accomplished the desired task.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a good habit to check the results of your code every time you finish a task.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you created or updated a data frame, make sure your edits did what you hoped.  Use the *Environment* or the `head()` function to investigate your changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Document your work\n",
        "\n",
        "In the text before the code chunk, make sure to briefly state what the point of the chunk is.  This will remind later readers - which might be your future self! - what the desired output is.\n",

        "Use comments in the code to give quick explanations of the goals of complex steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Two heads are better than one\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be hard to spot bugs in code that you yourself wrote.t\n",
        "(Have you ever sent a text message and not spotted an obvious  typo?  Same idea!)\n",
        "\n",
        "Work with people around you if you can - if something goes wrong, ask a friend to take a peek at your code and see if any glaring errors (like *syntax error*) pop out.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Explain your code out loud\n",
        "\n",
        "The best way to troubleshoot a sneaky bug is to explain out loud each step of your code, and what you hoped to accomplish.\n",
